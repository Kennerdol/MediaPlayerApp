Privacy Policy for Duducha Media Player

Effective Date: October 1, 2025

1. Introduction
Duducha Media Player (‚Äúthe App‚Äù) is developed as a personal media playback application. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user data.

2. Information We Collect
- The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers.
- User settings (such as themes, playlists, playback preferences) are stored locally on your device only.
- If you choose to create or upload playlists, those files are stored on your device and are not shared with us.

3. How Information Is Used
- Settings are stored locally to improve your experience (e.g., remembering theme preferences, last played files, or playlists).
- The App may check for updates (if enabled), which requires an internet connection to contact our update server. This process does not transmit any personal data.

4. Data Sharing
- We do not sell, share, or transfer any personal data to third parties.
- All data remains on your device unless you choose to share your files manually.

5. User Rights
- You may delete or reset your playlists and settings at any time by removing the app‚Äôs local storage/configuration files.
- Since no data is collected externally, there is nothing to request or erase beyond what is stored on your device.

6. Updates to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the App‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù or ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù section with a new effective date.
